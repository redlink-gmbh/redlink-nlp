 Function, tasks Assistant to the divisional head 

 Year of joining WACKER 2006 

 What is special about my time at WACKER is... It's very interesting. I have the opportunity to engage with people on all continents. 

 What is special about WACKER is... The size of the company and its international scope means that the tasks on offer are very varied. When business areas are closed or restructuring takes place, care is taken to ensure that all employees are offered a good alternative... 

 Where I want to be in ten years’ time: I’d like to be looking back on happy times in good health. 

 What was better than today 100 years ago? 1914 was a time of great dynamism and innovations, yet unfortunately saw the outbreak of the First World War. 

 What will be better than today in 100 years’ time? I’m hoping for world peace. 

 And the best thing about today is: We're warm and cozy, and have enough to eat. 

 What I would like to bring about at WACKER: More selfless responsibility for the WACKER cause. 

 What I would still like to try out in life: I’m giving painting a go and hope it will amount to something. 

 My favorite meal at the employee cafeteria: Scampi 

 My favorite celebration: WACKER’s summer party :-)
