     * analyses given in this document, we have chosen to take a traditional approach, showing the coordinated constituents
     * at the same level, with the conjunction between them (see also 47 and 48):

     * At phrase level, the noun phrase is probably the least problematic of the categories to be dealt
     * with. In general, a noun phrase will a have noun or a pronoun as its head, and included within
     * the noun phrase are the determinative elements, any premodification, and any postmodification.
     * The examples below, 14 to 17 show noun phrases with the head noun/pronoun in bold:
     * <pre>
     * (14)     [NP He NP] was a tiny man
     * (15)     [NP his white shirt cuffs NP]
     * (16)     [NP his surprisingly thick and hairy wrists NP]
     * (17)     [NP some wholly unanticipated but remotely possible event of absorbing interest NP]
     * </pre>
     * However, noun phrases may also occur with adjectival heads, as in 18 and 19:
     * <pre>
     * (18)     [NP The unemployed NP] have had enough
     * (19)     We've beaten [NP the best NP]
     * </pre>
     * or with a head which is a cardinal or ordinal number, as in 20 and 21:
     * <pre>
     * (20)     [NP The ninth NP] is my particular favourite
     * (21)     [NP The other seven NP] continued with the trip
     * </pre>
     * In `pro-drop' languages, such as Spanish and Italian, pronominal Subjects are usually not expressed.
     * Depending on the chosen type of analysis, this may require another definition of noun phrase, in order
     * to include `empty noun phrases', in which the pronoun is not actually present, but may be inferred
     * from the verb ending.
     * <p>
     * A classic constituency test for Noun Phrases is that only whole NPs can be moved within the same sentence.
     * In English, constituents can be preposed to achieve some effect, as in 23 (from Radford 1988: 70):
     * <pre>
     * (22)     I can't stand your elder sister
     * (23)     Your elder sister I can't stand (though your brother's OK).
     * </pre>
     * Examples 24 and 25 show that it is not possible to move only part of the NP:
     * <pre>
     * (24)     *Your elder I can't stand sister
     * (25)     *Elder sister, I can't stand your
     * </pre>
     * However, this test should be used with caution. It works well in English, but not always in other languages.
     * For example, in 26 Neue Bücher is moved to the beginning of the sentence while keine is left at the end:
     * <pre>
     * (26)     Neue    Bücher  habe    ich keine
     *          new books   have    I   no
     *          `I have not got any new books'

    NounPhrase(NounHeadedPhrase),
    /**
     * A sequence of a preposition and its complement is a prepositional phrase. The complement of a preposition is usually
     * a noun phrase (see examples 38 to 40), but may also be a clause or an adverb phrase. According to the categories
     * recommended here, a prepositional phrase may be analysed further into preposition and noun phrase. The examples
     * below demonstrate how this further analysis can be a recursive procedure.
     * <pre>
     * (38)     [PP en [NP sustitucion [PP de [NP los canales correspondientes [PP de [NP 50 baudios NP] PP] NP] PP] NP] PP].
     * (39)     [NP Fairbanks NP] [VP hummed [NP a few bars NP] VP] [PP in [NP a voice [VP made resonant
     *      [PP by [NP the very weakness [PP of [NP his chest NP] PP] NP] PP] VP] NP] PP].
     * (40)     [PP En [NP el caso [PP de [NP un sistema mixto [PP en [NP el
     *      [CL que [VP se utilicen [NP canales [PP con [NP tres velocidades
     *      [PP de [NP modulacion NP] PP] diferentes NP] PP] NP] VP] CL] NP] PP] NP] PP] NP] PP]
     * </pre>
     * In a language such as Spanish, where a large proportion of the modification of nouns takes the form of a following
     * preposition de and another noun, this recursion is extremely prevalent, as in 40. In cases where the prepositional
     * phrase is complemented by a one word noun phrase, it may be advantageous to leave the analysis at this point, rather
     * than continuing to analyse further by enclosing the complement (see also one-word constituents).

     */
    Phraseme(Phrase),
    /**
     * This category is slightly more difficult to define, since there is disagreement over the extent of the verb phrase.
     * In particular, should the verb phrase include only the words that are verbs, or should it also include the
     * complements of the verb? In the examples given in this document, and in the sample texts in the appendices, we have
     * chosen to include the complements, but it must be noted that this is an open issue, and we are in no way implying
     * that this analysis is preferable to the alternative. The choice to be made at this level, i.e. the inclusion or
     * exclusion of verbal complements in the Verb Phrase, is shown by the examples in 27 and 28, 27 showing the inclusion
     * of the complement of the verb in the verb phrase and 28 excluding the complement:
     * <pre>
     * (27)     He [VP took up [NP a clothes brush NP] VP]
     * (28)     He [VP took up VP] [NP a clothes brush NP]
     * </pre>
     * An advantage in the type of analysis shown in 27 is that the relative levels of the constituents can be shown to a
     * greater extent -- i.e. complements of the verb are included in the verb phrase, while adjuncts and peripheral
     * adverbials are left at sentence level.
     * <p>
     * However, in a case where an adjunct occurs before the complement of the verb, the approaches used in 27 and 28 would
     * cause problems, since either both the adjunct and the complement would be included as daughters of the verb phrase,
     * or both would be daughters of the sentence, rather than keeping the complement as a daughter of the verb phrase and
     * the adjunct as a sister of the verb phrase. These problems may be solved by an additional notation, but at some
     * level, arbitrariness is inevitable.
     * <p>
     * Regardless of the choice made over the extent of the Verb Phrase, there arises a problem of discontinuous Verb
     * Phrases. A complex verbal construction may be discontinuous, e.g. the auxiliary and the main verb are separated in
     * inverted constructions in English, or the main verb is positioned at the end of the sentence in German and Dutch.
     * Such discontinuity can be avoided by having different labels and constituents for the auxiliary verb and the main
     * verb, resulting in an analysis as shown in the Dutch example 29 below:
     * <pre>
     * (29)     [NP Ze NP] [AUX zullen AUX] [ADVP er ADVP] [VP [NP de VN-agenda
     *      [PP voor [NP het komende jaar NP] PP] NP] behandelen VP].
     * </pre>
     * and in the English interrogative inverted example 30, using the so-called `dummy auxiliary' do:
     * <pre>
     * (30)     [AUX Do AUX] [NP they NP] [VP confide [PP in you PP] VP]?
     * </pre>
     * As with Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases can be identified by a constituency test. In strong constituency languages like
     * English, the whole VP can be moved, but not part of it: compare 31 and 32:
     * <pre>
     * (31)       Give in to blackmail, I never will
     * (32)     *Give in, I never will to blackmail
     * </pre>
     * However, there are languages in which constituent tests do not work. These will typically be languages with flexible
     * word order, such as Finnish. 33 is an example of a discontinuous VP (Vilkuna 1989: 26):
     * <pre>
     * (33)     Maailmaa    nähnyt  hän on.
     *      world-Part  seen    he  is
     *      `He IS a widely-travelled person.'
     * </pre>
     * For Finnish, then, evidence for a VP is less convincing than it is for English, and a dependency approach seems the
     * more natural choice. (Covington (1990) provides a parsing strategy for variable word order languages and Covington
     * (1991) for parsing discontinuous constituents, both using a dependency syntax approach.)
     * <p>
     * In Italian also, constituency tests cannot be applied. This can be shown through the distribution of VP-adverbs
     * (e.g. completamente `completely', intenzionalmente `intentionally', attentamente `carefully') and S-adverbs (e.g.
     * probabilmente `probably', certamente `certainly'). In English, these different classes of adverbs have a different
     * distribution within the sentence. In contrast, in Italian, the distinct adverb classes cannot be distinguished on
     * the basis of their distribution in the sentence. S-adverbs and VP-adverbs can occur in the same positions within the
     * sentence, as illustrated in examples 34 to 37:
     * <pre>
     * (34)     Attentamente/certamente, il bambino ascoltó la storia
     *      `Carefully/certainly, the child listened to the story'
     * (35)     Il bambino attentamente/certamente ascoltó la storia
     *      `The child carefully/certainly listened to the story'
     * (36)     Il bambino ascoltó attentamente/certamente la storia
     *      `The child listened carefully/certainly to the story'
     * (37)     Il bambino ascoltó la storia attentamente/certamente
     *      `The child listened to the story carefully/certainly'
     * </pre>
     * Thus, in Italian as well as other languages, neither the position nor the syntactic context can help to decide
     * whether an adverb is an S-adverb or a VP-adverb; this can only be stated by considering its semantic content and the
     * way it relates to the content of the predicate or the sentence. This situation has consequences for the success of
     * standard VP-tests.

     * </pre>
     * In Bangla, the gerund form takes the suffix –A / -Ano, while the infinitive marker is –we. The syntactic distribution of these two forms of verbs is different. For example, the gerund form is allowed in the context of the word darakAra “necessary” while the infinitive form is not, as exemplified below:

     * b10 Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN darakAra
